# TMDB TASK
TMDB Task is a single page application using JavaScript to integrate with an API and use the data to display a list of movies.

## Installation
Download the files into one directory and click on the index.html file to open the page in your browser.

## Notes
I initially wrote indexv1.html which has a fixed top filter bar, when I tested this on a phone I found that the filter bar was all I could see. So I changed it which you can see in index.html. This now has a left hand side bar which I think works better. 

On a very small screen index.html is not fully responsive as the sidebar and size of the movie images is too wide. To resolve this I would probably make the side bar a slide out bar or have a drop down menu from the very top showing all the filters.

I have tested this file on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera and it works well in all. The only problem I have come across is that it loads fine in Firefox but if you refresh the page after it's initial load it won't load again. I'm not sure why this is.
