# TMDB TASK
TMDB Task is a single page application using JavaScript to integrate with an API and use the data to display a list of movies.

## Installation
Download the files into one directory and click on the index.html file to open the page in your browser.

## Notes
I initially wrote indexv1.html which has a fixed top navigation bar, however when I tested this on a phone I found that as the navigation bar was all I could see. So I changed it which you can see in index.html. This now has a side bar which I think works better. 

On a very small screen index.html is not fully responsive as the sidebar and size of the moovie images is too wide. To resolve this I would probably make the side bar a slide out bar or popssibly have a drop down menu from the very top showing all the filters.

I have tested this file on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera and the only problem I have come across is that it loads fine in Firefox but if you refresh the page it won't load properly. I'm not sure why this is.
